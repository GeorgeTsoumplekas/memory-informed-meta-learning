# MemINP: Memory Enhanced Neural Processes for Understanding-Based Informed Meta-Learning

This repository contains the code for the report "MemINP: Memory Enhanced Neural Processes for Understanding-Based Informed Meta-Learning".

The code included here is based on the code from the paper "Informed Meta-Learning".

## Synthetic Data
`jobs/run_sinusoids.sh` contains commands that need to be run to reproduce the experiments with synthetic data.

After training the models, results can be analyzed with the following notebook:
- `evaluation/evaluate_sinusoids.ipynb` contains the analysis of the included experiments
